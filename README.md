## Alpine Linux
https://www.alpinelinux.org/

"Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox."

"Alpine Linux was designed with security in mind. The kernel is patched with grsecurity/PaX out of the box, and all userland binaries are compiled as Position Independent Executables (PIE) with stack smashing protection. These proactive security features prevent exploitation of entire classes of zero-day and other vulnerabilities."


"If I had just one recommendation for you, I.G., it’s Alpine Linux. It combines nice features of Arch, BSD, and Gentoo atop heavy security: musl, busybox, LibreSSL, grsecurity/PaX, PIE, OpenRC, anti-systemd philosophy, package signing, lightness. The docs are not up to par yet, but you can find your way around, and the community is nice."
